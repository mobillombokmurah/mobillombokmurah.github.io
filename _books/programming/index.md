I have been learning to program since 2018, when I started to study for my BSc in Computer Science. My specialities during my BSc include: Machine Learning; Engineering and Public Policy; Interaction Design; and Information Security. I am proficient in several programming languages and frameworks, and continue to pursue my interests in Machine Intelligence and Ethical AI. Here you can find more information about some of the programming projects I have worked on.
