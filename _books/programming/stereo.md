# Stereo Matching Algorithm (University Project)
## 2018

As a university project we were asked to implement a stereo matching algorithm, involving dynamic programming and forward and backward propogation, to calculate a depth map for a pair of stereo images. This was my first brush with something resembling machine learning. It was a challenging project which required a lot of perseverence for a beginner coder as I was then.
