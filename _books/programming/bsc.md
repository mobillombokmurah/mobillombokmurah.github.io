# BSc Computer Science
## 2018 - 2021

At the age of 24 I went to university as a mature student to study for an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. Apart from having A level maths, I did not come from a mathematical background, instead having spent the preceeding years working in creative industries, so it was a bit of a shock to find myself back in a classroom! The experience of my BSc has been highly challenging and rewarding, and beyond learning specific skills or technologies, I feel that what I have learnt more than anything else is the art of perseverence when tackling hard problems. The attitude of not being afraid to fail, of actively trying to break things, of cultivating a constant attitude of curiosity and discipline (and believing that you can figure anything out with enough internet searches!) are what I really have taken away from my degree. 

In my first two years I covered a number of different technologies, theories and frameworks, gaining a grounding in:
* Various Computer Programming languages including Python, C#, C and Java
* Object Oriented Programming, Design Patterns, and Software design best practices including Version Control, Scrum and Agile workflows
* Functional Programming in Haskell
* Mathematics (Pure & Discrete) and Statistics
* Formal Logic
* Databases / SQL
* Information Security
* Engineering and Public Policy
* Algorithm Design, Data structures, and complexity
* Compiler design
* Concurrency and mutli-threaded programming
* Computer Architecture / Assembly
* Basic Web design, HTML/CSS/Javascript

In my third and final year I am currently studying:
* Applied Machine Learning including introductions to Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning
* Network technologies and systems
* Digital Technologies and Public Policy
* Interaction Design

I achieved excellent grades, getting a 1st class (75%) grade in my second year.
