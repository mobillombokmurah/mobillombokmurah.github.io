# BSc Project

In my final year at university I am looking at generating music from body movement using motion capture data, working as part of an international research project called EnTimeMent. My project will explore different machine learning models in both the recognition of human movement from mocap data, and the generating of music from that data. The project aims to explore how generating music from movement could provide feedback to the person who is moving, encouraging them to become more aware of their body and change or explore the way they move in response to the music. This might be used in a healthcare context with people suffering from range of movement difficulties, or in a creative context with dancers and musicians.
