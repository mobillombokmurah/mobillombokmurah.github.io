# Augmented Reality Patient Clipboard
## 2020

As part of a two day Hackathon organised with Great Ormond Street Hostpital (GOSH), I designed an augmented reality clipboard to display patient data to clinicians, as an alternative to the traditional clipboards which display information next to patients' beds in a hospital. I used Unity and the AR Foundation package to design a cross-platform mobile application which connected to the FHIR API, developed by GOSH, to fetch and display patient data. 

My project was one of 6 chosen from 116 to be presented to Microsoft in June 2020, after which an abstract was submitted for inclusion in the GOSH conference 2020.
