# Sptifire Audio Software Engineering Internship
## Summer 2020

Whilst interning at Spitfire Audio, I was a contributing member of the team working to build a new web and native content management and delivery system to deal with the organisationâ€™s very large sets of audio files. This involved using the Laravel PHP framework, as well as a C# native app and Python code running on backend servers. I also took the lead on migrating a local database to the cloud and building an API using AWS to allow the team to work remotely with a database that was stored on office-based servers.
