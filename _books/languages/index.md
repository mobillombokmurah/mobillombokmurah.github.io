For a long time I have enjoyed learning modern foreign languages, and I speak several apart from my native language, which is English. I try to keep up these languages by reading or speaking with friends, and I relish any opportunity to travel or practice them. My eyes have been opened to different ways of seeing the world by learning other languages, and for me there is nothing like the simple pleasure of finding a good untranslateable word!
