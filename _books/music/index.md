Music is my first love. I trained and worked as a freelance music producer and audio engineer, producing tracks for pop singer-songwriters as well as performing in bands and making music for adverts and theatre. Although I no longer work professionally as a musician, I continue to write, produce and perform my own songs. Here is a selection of work that I am particularly proud of.
