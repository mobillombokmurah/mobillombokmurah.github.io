# Creature & Machine
## 2020+

Recently I've been making music under the name Creature & Machine. My music blends organic and electronic sounds, and I enjoy experimenting with new ways of performing live. I also make generative visuals from my music using the Processing framework. You can find my recent music on [streaming platforms](https://ditto.fm/creature-machine "streaming platforms") and on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/creatureandmachine "Instagram"). 

Watch this space for new music coming in Winter 2020.

I'm terrible at promoting my music but I'm trying to get better at it! If you like my music and would like to help me out, please get in touch.
