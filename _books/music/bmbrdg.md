# bmbrdg
## 2017

I released an album under the (un-pronounceable) name "bmbrdg" which stands for Bamboo Bridge. I used field recordings from my time livng in Japan - for example, you can hear buddhist monks in "Captivate" and Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing in "Captor".

You can find this album on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5liVsVHlaJZIttb5BPXNVv?si=dzeumPOeQ5eUwLBF6Glupg "Spotify") and by searching "bmbrdg" on other streaming platforms.
