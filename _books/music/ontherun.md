# Tell Me Anything - On The Run Theatre
## 2016

I worked with On the Run Theatre during their residencies at Shoreditch Town Hall and Camden People's Theatre to help devise live soundtrack to their 2016 show [Tell Me Anything](https://www.ontheruntheatre.co.uk/tell-me-anything "Tell Me Anything"). This including improvising live in rehearsals and scratch performances, playing different live electronics and acoustic instruments.
