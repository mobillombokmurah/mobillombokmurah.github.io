# Student Mentor and Representative
## 2018 - 2020

During my first year of my BSc I was a student representative for the year group. This involved mediating between students and staff after significant changes had been made to the curriculum. As a result of our lobbying, the university decided to introduce a dual level intake in the first year that took into account the fact that some students had never coded before arriving at university, whilst some had a lot of experience.

In addition, during my second year I took on the role of a mentor to younger students, and an anonymous student listening volunteer. For these roles I underwent training to understand how to be an active listener and create a welcoming space for students to bring difficult or problematic experiences.
