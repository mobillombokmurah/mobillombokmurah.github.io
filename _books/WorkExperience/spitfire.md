## Summer 2020

As an intern at the sample library company, Spitire Audio, I worked with all three software teams on different aspects of the company's software infrastructure, including being involved in the early design stages of establishing a new custom content management system. I worked with PHP Laravel and C++ JUCE, as well as AWS pipeline (S3, Aurora, Lambdas, API)
