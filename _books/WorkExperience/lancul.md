## 2016

Whilst living in Tokyo, Japan for six months in 2016, I worked as a conversational assistant at Lancul language cafe. This involved teaching and practicing English with learners in an informal setting. This required a cheerful and patient attitude, and an open disposition to discussing and understanding the differences between Japanese and English culture.
