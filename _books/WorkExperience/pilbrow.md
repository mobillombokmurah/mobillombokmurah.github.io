# Research and Administrative Assistant

## 2017 - 2018

I worked part-time for the architectural practice, Pilbrow & Partners, as a research & administrative assistant. My responsibilities included conducting historical and social research for planning applications, including visiting archives and searching through archival resources, and supporting the compilation of project reports, using Adobe Creative Suite software. I also supported different teams in the practice with research and writing, including the marketing and software teams. 

In addition, I transitioned into the role of adminstrative assistant to the head partner, which involved a range of HR tasks, organising the partners diaries and responding to phone and email communication. This role required a very high level of adaptability, resourcefulness and flexibility in an extremely fast paced environment. During my time at the practice, I was also responsible for conceiving, organising and leading an office trip to take 40 people to Northern Norway to visit an architectural trail, without the help of a travel agent.
