I have developed a strong interest in and practice of mindfulness, which is a practice I feel passionately about. It's helped me massively, and I love deepening my own practice by guiding meditations. As the treasurer of the UCL Mindful Society I guide regular online and in person meditations, and also organise several initiatives including a course of mindfulness teacher training for a small group, and Mindful walking.
