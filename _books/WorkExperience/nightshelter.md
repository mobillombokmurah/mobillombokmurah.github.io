*Islington Winter Night Shelter*
## 2017-2018

During the winter of 2017-2018 I volunteered on overnight shifts at the Islington winter night shelter. This involved sleeping in the shelter overnight to ensure the smooth running of the shelter and the comfort and safety of the service users. This experience was very eye opening for me to start to understand the situation that homeless people face in London, some of the reasons that homelessness is increasing, and some of the barriers that homeless people face to returning to a stable living situation.
