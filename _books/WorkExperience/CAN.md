# Founder and Coordinator
[Computer Aid Network]()
## 2020

During the Covid-19 lockdown, I started connecting with older members of my local community in order to help them with fixing minor computer problems and get them set up with basic connected technologies such as Skype or Zoom. At the same time, I was teaching a few friends to code. I realised how much need there was for both of these skillsets - coding skills for the younger generation; and digital literacy for the older. I therefore set up a project to increase these digital skills in both generations,whilst facilitating connections between the two.

Computer Aid Network (CAN) is a network of youth volunteers, currently operating in London, who partner with community centres to help teach older people how to make digital technology work better for them. In return, the young volunteers recieve a free course of coding lessons. We aim to increase connections between the generations whilst improving digital literacy in all generations.
