# Freelance Music Producer
## 2014-2017

I worked as a freelance music producer and audio engineer, after having trained at Alchemea College of Audio Engineering (now SAE). Being a freelancer required me to learn to motivate and organise myself, as well as dealing with client relationships and working in different configurations and teams.
