# Volunteer in Arusha, Tanzania

In 2013 I had the opportunity to live in Arusha, Tanzania for 9 months, where I worked as a volunteer teacher in a school, a volunteer for a residential post-op centre for disabled children, [Plaster House](https://www.theplasterhouse.org), and as an English tutor. As an english teacher in the local primary school, I was responsible for two classes of 60-70 students between the ages of 11 and 15. As a 19 year old, there were many challenging aspects of this experience, and I had to be resourceful and use my creativity to keep discipline and keep the students engaged. It also required a lot of emotional resilience to deal with some of the difficult aspects of being confronted with stark inequalities and injustices. 

The experience that I had in Tanzania is very hard to put into words, but formed a lot of the person I am today - although as an older and wiser adult, I now have some serious qualms about the kind of 'voluntourism' that originally took me there. However, I still maintain connections in Arusha and I very much hope to return to Tanzania in the future.
